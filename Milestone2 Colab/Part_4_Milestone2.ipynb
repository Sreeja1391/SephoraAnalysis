I love it and it doesn’t taste funny. I use about half a scoop every time, using included the applicator. When applied, it doesn’t leave a yellow or orange color on my pale pink lips. I actually taped the applicator on top of the lid since it seems it can be easily lost.

Just wanted to show you guys the color and compare it to the Gingersnap one which was discontinued and which I’m still hoping they will bring back... So, the texture and feel on the lips are the same as all the other Laneige lip masks.  It feels smooth, not grainy at all, kind of like a thick gel but without being sticky or leaving any kind of residue on the lips as it fades.  Those are the positive attributes of this one BUT, sadly, as with the previous limited edition of the Cherry one, I’m disappointed with the scent.  It does smell vaguely of pumpkin spice but in a plasticky, fake kind of way and without any kind of sweetness added to it.  After a couple of minutes on the lips the smell dissipates completely and the slight aftertaste you are left with is reminiscent of vaseline in some way, very artificial...Compared to my beloved Gingersnap (on the left in the included picture), it doesn’t add even the slightest bit of tint to your lips and, of course, doesn’t smell nearly as good.  So, if you are looking to replace your Gingersnap mask (like me) this won’t do it but overall, it’s a good product and does the job it’s intended for.  Moisturizing, doesn’t interfere with other products you plan to apply afterward (when used during the day) and is definitely suitable for this time of the year (I’m writing this in September).  So, if you are just looking for something to “refresh“ your Laneige arsenal, this would be a good addition to it but don’t expect a sweet, gourmand pumpkin spice smell and/or taste.\",Good but not a very natural flavour...,light,green,combination,blonde,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0,positive\n",

It’s garbage. I have been using it for months and even when I cake the product on my lips and sleep for 12 hours, my lips look just as bad the next morning. Only way this product does anything for my lips is if I use it every night without breaks and even then the difference is minimal. I purchased the full size after using sample sizes of the original on and off for years and finding it to be the only thing able to rescue my lips overnight.

It’s a large pot and I know it will last a long time. Worth the price for that. The consistency is perfect. There’s many balms out there but some are too thin when you apply it. I want it to be thick! It’s thick but super sticky, feels very creamy. I heard the hype and decided to try it and it came through. Now…the complaint, which for some may be a plus, or no biggie…it doesn’t taste or smell like vanilla. I want to try another flavor to see if it’s just this particular flavor that’s weak, but I saw a review for the berry one and the lady said the taste and smell were very faint. I was expecting this yummy flavor and was so disappointed. Overall, great product!

The first time I used it, I applied a thin layer like I would lip balm and I was underwhelmed. Then I read a review that said to really slather it on like a night mask and that made all the difference! A little goopy and sticky so just make sure not to get it all over your pillow if you’re a side sleeper like me. My lips were not dry to begin with but now feel super soft and lasts throughout the day.

I have to keep chapstick in many rooms in my house, as well as in my car and all of my purses, so that I don’t ever go without it on accident. This lip sleeping mask isn’t meant to be used as chapstick and I understand that. When I first started using it, I used it as intended. However, I just really grew to love it and, slowly iver time, I began choosing this over my Burt’s Bee’s chapstick that had been my favorite and only kind I would use. Originally, I bought this mask in a kit, so it was a smaller container. The full size container is too big for me to carry around and I don’t want to contaminate it. So what I did was I kept the small container and cleaned it and then I added some from the big to the small. Any time I need to add more to the small container, I clean it/sanitize it beforehand and do my best to avoid contaminating the big container (especially since it’s going to lay me a really long time!).\",My new favorite “chapstick”,fair,blue,combination,red,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0,positive\n",

It’s extremely easy to use, and the grapefruit scent/taste isn’t offensive if you’re looking for a scent-free option like I was. It’s just a little sweet and fruity. I didn’t want to get the vanilla because that would be entirely too sweet for me. This was the perfect balance for me. So, I used it on a night when I literally couldn’t talk, my lips were so dry, and the next day my lips were so soft my partner said I always gave the best, softest, kisses. And I was kissing them with abandon with no fear of hurting my lips! Though I put the mask on again that night, and the next day my lips were even better! This mask is a gift that I never thought I could receive. I am so grateful I got a sample so I could try it and understand just how it works so I could buy a bottle for myself.

I hate dry cracked lips and other than Medicated Blistex.. nothing seemed to work until I found this! Even my fiancée is pushing me to get two of the new flavours in full sizes since he has started using it too! We wear it through the day as well not just over night. We do NOT wash it off EVER and our lips have never felt better! We are a pretty affectionate couple so we kiss a lot and his whiskers often chafe up my lips and surrounding skin but …this gets rid of the lip irritation in no time! If my lips become super dry & peely.. this lip mask seems to slough off peeling skin at the source and seal the little nasty paper like cuts the peeled skin leaves. I’m so excited to get the new flavours and I hope they actually taste good! I’m out of samples now so .. I’m going to jump in like Hubby wants me to and order 2. If they are not up to standard.. I’ll return them but I really hope that’s not the case.  He said doesn’t even care if there’s a pigment .. that’s how much he loves this!  I’m really hoping that the full size is actually the same quality as the sample size since there have been some comments in that regard. It’s not cool to lure us with a great product if you are changing the amount of certain ingredients in the full sizes. The last thing I want is drier lips. Summer is just around the corner so we will be all set!

It is so pretty and the plumping is so subtle and does not sting like others. I wear this during the day because of how soft it makes my lips. The only reason I put 4 stars is because the flavor is very strong and slightly reminds me of grape cough medicine.

If you own any of the other ones, the consistency and effect are exactly the same.  However, after having used it twice now, I find myself being bothered a bit by the strong flavor of this one.  If you’ve ever owned the blue Ralph Lauren perfume, it tastes exactly like that perfume smells, if that makes any sense.  Normally, I’m not opposed to scented or flavored products but it feels like something you are putting on your lips shouldn’t have such a strong perfume flavor though.  Weirdly enough, the scent itself isn’t very strong...  I love all the other “flavors“ of this product (Gingerbread was my favorite, why, why why did they discontinue it?) but this will be my least favorite, to be honest.  If you are looking for a sweet type of scent or something with a hint of vanilla - this isn’t it.

I’ve gone on vacations and didn’t bring this, and within a few days my lips were back to being a flakey mess. I wish it weren’t in a tub, but the texture is firmer than vaseline but softer than a traditional lip balm, so I understand why it is. It also softens from the heat of my finger, so is easy to remove and apply (just perhaps not the most sanitary!). One tub also lasts a long time.

I’ve had terribly dry lips as long as I can remember with a bad habit of hitting and picking at them. I have issues with bleeding, scabbing, flaking, you name it when I don’t proactively take care of my lips. Especially living in a northern climate with regular subzero temps. This lip mask is literally magic. The only thing that has ever worked for me, and I don’t even notice it until I run out and remember what it was like before! Seriously, if you struggle with dryness like I described I would try it. The price is really good with how much product youre actually getting. It is very sticky, and that can take getting used to, but my god I’ve never actually had a beauty product that works as well as this one does.

So in that way, I prefer it to Vaseline. I use it over lip balm every night and wake up with it still on my lips. I never have chapped or dry lips now, even in the dry Midwest winters.

It does exactly what it says and I even use it throughout the day now (just not as much on as when applying before bed). I posted the best photos I had with lighting  to show the difference it made.

I actually use this more as my everyday “lip balm“ rather than a mask. I generally hate normal lip balms because I feel like they make my lips worse off -- even if it helps in the moment, it makes my lips more sensitive/prone to dryness and creates a dependency on them that drives me nuts. But this product makes my lips so so soft and hydrated without any of that. I use a very light layer of this during the day and just it looks like a pretty gloss, and then a thicker layer of it at night as a mask whenever I need some extra hydration. If I forget about it and don’t use it for a week or two, my lips still feel really good unlike with regular chapstick.

I got the regular mini as a birthday gift and loved it so much, so decided to go for a larger one and keep the mini in my purse. I typically avoid using fragrance in my skincare routine because I have sensitive lips and skin but this hasn’t caused any irritation on my lips or the surrounding skin area. If you don’t like anything with fragrance or smells I would still definitely recommend the original. The original has a pretty dull, but pleasant smell. The gingersnap smell is so amazing and genuinely brings joy to my life - I know that sounds crazy but it’s so true. When using this lip mask overnight I wake up with super hydrated lips. I previously used aquaphor, which is nice, but I realized is really just a barrier. This actually works to hydrate your lips and acts as a barrier as well. I didn’t realize this came with a lip applicator wand but it’s a really nice touch and prevents me from having to wash my hands for the millionth time throughout my skincare routine. I also really enjoy wearing this during the day as a lip balm/gloss because it really gives off a glossy look also. Definitely would recommend!

I have tried both the Berry and Vanilla versions (and finished several jars of each) and anytime a large sale rolls around I usually toss one into my cart. The product smell is an overall HUGE hit (except for the Gummy Bear scent that smells horrific to me and is their only true miss in the scent category). One of the top perks is just how yummy this smells on the lips, I reach for it often during times when my lips just need a little bit of a pick-me-up. This is a light-weight type of product, not what you’d expect out of something labeled a “mask“ but I do enjoy how glide-able it is on the lips in comparison to thicker masks/balms. The jar is extremely durable and its easy to tag it along inside a bag or even on airline travels. I also noticed over the years that I oftentimes bring this along on plane rides with me, it’s a godsend for that dry airplane air (if you know, you know). The Bad: As previously stated the Gummy Bear scent is something you should avoid if you actually like gummy bears because it smells way more like children’s cough syrup to me. Also, I have to say I would NOT consider this a mask. If you are looking for something to combat HARSH northern winters this simply won’t cut it most of the time and you need to purchase a different product. I would consider this more of a hydrating lip “cream“ as opposed to a mask and I really think that would be a more appropriate labeling for this product. The Ugly/Honest: This product lasts a long time which is great but the fact that you have to dig your finger into this to get product is a little off-putting. I know they used to come with a little tiny plastic scooper (maybe they still do) but it’s so tiny and flimsy that I always end up losing mine somewhere to no avail. Overall, this is a decent product but it’s NOT a lip mask.\",\"I Love This Stuff, But Here's The HONEST Review...\",light,hazel,combination,brown,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0,positive\n",

I was actually convinced by the cashier to get this set vs the others they had left because she told me how popular this sleeping lip mask was so I was sold. Bring it on!  I have to say when you apply it to your lips it feels really soft and goes on really smooth. That was a good start.  I put it on at night and I didn’t notice anything spectacular about it truthful I didn’t notice anything different after using it. My lips can get really dry in the winter and I do have lip lines which I don’t like. So I have been looking to find something that will improve them or at least improve the appearance of them. This isn’t it.   For $22, I would not buy. I have a way less expensive lip balm in Aloe vera that soothes and moisturizes my lips just fine.  I love Laneige but I love this product but I don’t hate it either.\",Not for me...not for $22,lightMedium,green,dry,black,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0,negative\n",

I’m not one to go for expensive products (this is expensive to me lol), I usually just go for drug store stuff, but this is amazing and definitely worth it. Makes my lips so plump when I wake up. It makes them bigger basically. It also makes them feel very hydrated at first and prevents chapped lips. I also sometimes wear it during the day and it’s not as effective as keeping it on overnight with no lip movement, but it does help with overall lip hydration during your day :) I’ve been using it for 3 months and stopped using it for about a month and honestly, I can tell the difference between my lips before and my lips now (they especially help during winter)!

I originally had the Berry flavor, but because I hated the smell so much, I only used it a few times before abandoning it. Then I saw some of these new released holiday flavors. I actually wanted to order peppermint as well, but sadly that was sold out. So I got gingersnap. I couldn’t remember how I felt, so I started using the Berry flavor again in the meantime, before this arrived. The formula was actually way better than I remembered, it works super well at keeping my lips soft and doesn’t dry them out even after it fades a little. That being said, I really still dislike the Berry flavor. It’s very medicinal to me. So I was really looking forward to gingersnap. Sadly, gingersnap does not at all smell like gingersnaps. It’s got none of that spicy smell. It’s very sweet, and like a review I read on this flavor earlier, smells very much like maple syrup. Because of that, I deduct a point (or half a point really). The smell isn’t terrible, just not gingersnap. It’s vaguely reminiscent of fresh’s caramel balm smell I think. So far from the couple of times I’ve tried it, the formula is pretty much the same! Big fan. I hope they release more scents though. I would love to see Peach Tea rereleased, since right now only Vanilla appeals to me from what’s available.\",\"Great Formula, Smells Like Maple Syrup\",light,brown,combination,black,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0,positive\n",

Peach Tea is 5 stars. Gummy bear is 1 or 2 stars sadly.Originally, I bought the Peach Tea one in July 2021. As you can tell from the pics of the jar- I loved it. Zero complaints, it was moisturizing and totally worth the money. No weird aftertaste on your lips. In December 2021, I ran out of peach tea. I ordered the Gummy Bear one (the regular gummy bear- not the BTS version). I hate it! It smells lovely and sweet but I can taste it (just from being on my lips- I’m not licking it or anything weird as I am an adult lol). It tastes like straight chemicals just “yuck” taste on my lips. Again, the smell is fine but I cannot get over the taste. I barely have used it, whereas the peach tea one I’d use 30x a day lol I was obsessed. Idk why there is a difference between the two, I no longer have the peach tea box and the jar itself has the exact same description between the two. Also, I don’t have like an over sensitive taste buds or something, I’m pretty immune to lightly scented or flavored things lol so I really don’t know why this is so bad.

I’ve tried so many brands and types of lip balms and they weren’t effective. As soon as the balm would wear off a little I could feel the dead skin starting up. I was actually debating on going to a derm about it because nothing was working and not using anything made it worse. I gave this a shot I’m so very very impressed. Granted I’ve only been using it for a few days, but I’ve never had a lip mask/product work so well so quick. It has kind of a thick almost sticky consistency to it and it really clings on. I haven’t noticed a taste and the berry scent is very light.

The product applies like petroleum jelly so it feels like it will be hydrating but the next day my lips are a mess. I wonder if la neige fudged the formula for the bday samples?

SO STRAP IN, Y’ALL.  I’ve used all the lip balms ... Sugar (too drying), Jack Black (sticky, hit-or-miss flavors), Smith’s Rosebud (great, but literally impossible to open the tin), Smith’s Rosebud Salve (too thin), Carmex (tastes like garbage), Vaseline (thin, but decent), etc.  THIS IS MY HOLY GRAIL.  It’s T H I C C, so it doesn’t come off when you eat / drink / sleep / wear a face mask. I use it as my 24/7 lip balm and slather it on at night. It’s a thick pleasant goop that’s not sticky, feels smooth, doesn’t rub off, tastes great and (most importantly) leaves your lips moisturized instead of thirsty for more (looking @ u, Chapstick). They all look like a clear soft gloss on. Flavors: the original berry is a perfect mild starter. lemon was awesome, mint choco was good. in store, gummy bear and sweet candy both smelled pleasantly sweet but not overpowering, vanilla smelled nice - a little strong but i hate vanilla tbh, gingersnap (seasonal) smelled nice but a little cookie-y and i’m afraid i’d get sick of it. peppermint (seasonal) smelled AMAZING and i’m currently stalking my stores to get my hands on it. Just get this. Grab it as a reward if you can, or get a gift set to try the flavors orrrr keep 1 and gift the others.  Either way, get this. Throw your other balms out.

I stalked my local Sephora for days trying to grab one as soon as it dropped (this was not necessary, I’m just an enthusiastic shopper) and I’m really glad I did because this version is amazing.This mask has kind of a sweet-peppermint scent: not quite pure mint and a little more reminiscent of the candy.  It’s very light and is usually gone after a few minutes, with a very subtle cooling sensation when first applied.  I find it a refreshing combination and perfect for winter and the holidays!Unlike the original, there is no pink tint to this one - it’s white/clear.  I don’t mind it because I wear this at night, but you do lose that light juicy “glow“.  This version still has the same hydrating care, which is an absolute must now that it’s getting colder and drier at night.In the end this is still my favorite lip balm/mask/treatment/whatever the cool kids are calling it these days.  There’s a lot of comparison between this one and the Tatcha Kissu, which I’ve also tried.  The Tatcha one has a little more slip right off the bat (the Laneige needs to warm up a little on the lips to really melt and sink in), but this one has staying power and lasts through the whole night.  I’m so sad this is limited edition, hopefully everyone who wants one can snag it ASAP!And yes, this one also comes with the cute spatula!\",Wintry and Sweet!,light,brown,dry,black,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0,positive\n",

I have been devoted to the Bite Agave+ Intensive Lip Mask, but this is a real competitor. I keep testing back and forth to see which one is better under what conditions, but I think it is a toss up. The Laneige is a little waxier, which makes it stay longer at night. The Bite is a little stickier and disappears into my lips faster, so I think it’s better for under lipstick. Both have this way of absorbing into your dry spots and helping them slough off without needing any scrubbing granules. I’ve never tried any lip treatment that is as good as either of these.

It wasn’t available to order online, but I was able to snag it via in-store pick up. I’ve been using the Berry one religiously every night for a 18 months (package says it’s good for 12, but there aren’t any signs of spoilage) and am about 3/4th of the way done - this stuff lasts so freaking long, I was hesitant to even dip into a new one, but I just had to try it! So for those curious if the peppermint worth seeking out if you already have a Laneige lip mask product, I’d say not really. Everything minty about it (smell and cooling effect) is very mild. At first application, you don’t feel anything, then that cool sensation starts to creep in a few minutes later, faintly lingers for a few minutes, then completely goes away within 10 minutes. Don’t get me wrong, this product regardless of the scent is a staple for me and has truly reduced that “my-lips-always-feel-chapped” feeling, and all-in-all, I’m not mad about having another open jar of the stuff since I can put one on my night stand now.

Ever since I was a child I had this split lip that scarred terribly and reopens anytime my lips are even a little dry. When this happens and the scar tissue reopens, it hurts a lot. It makes a lot of things unbearable for me because if anything got in the wound it would sting. I’ve tried multiple brands of chapstick, aquaphor, oils. Nothing. My lips would still split when I would wake up in the morning. This however, changed all that for me. I figured it can’t hurt and wow. Day 3 and not only is my wound closed, my lips aren’t dry even in the slightest. I slathered this stuff on before I went to bed too. I made sure to get the really bad parts of my lip and wow. Just wow. I’m in no pain anymore and my lips are so soft. It’s healing on top of it. If anyone has similar experiences like I do get this, it’s so worth it to not be in pain I’ll pay the $20.

I’ll never do that again, this is the best lip product I’ve ever used. I struggle with very dry and chapped lips, dr bronners lip balm, A&D ointment, aquaphor, medicated lip balm, you name it I’ve tried it, nothing really seemed to truly moisturize my lips quite the way I was looking for, even with drinking a crap ton of water to stay hydrated and continuously having something in my lips throughout the day. I tried the mini version of this mask after I had a cold that entailed a lot of most blowing and my lips were just cracked and sore from all of the friction from the tissues against my nose and lip area. This healed my chapped lips in 2 days, I kid you not. I seriously thought it was too good to be true so I went a few days without it just to see what would happen. A little chapped but nothing like I would have experienced had I not used any lip product before bed for even one night. My lips have continuously never felt this soft or hydrated since I’ve been using this product, ended up getting the holiday set so I have a few smaller sizes to carry in my purse with me and leave at my parents house when I visit them.

I’ve been using this almost every night since March when I got it as the birthday gift (and there is still plenty left because you need just the TINIEST amount!). Yes there are times my lips are dry and peeling the next morning, but that doesn’t mean it’s not working. Think how snake skin peels off. I live in the desert and just before the snakes shed their skins, we find them coiled up next to the puddles behind the livestock water buckets. The next day their skin is on the ground intact, but they are gone! The days I get up with peeling lips, it either tells me I am dehydrated, needing a good lip exfoliation, or both! Once that dry skin has been removed with a good lip exfoliator, my lips are SO amazingly soft! When i first started using the Laneige, i used a sugar scrub more often but now i only need to about once a month. ;)  I’m happy for our upcoming discount …I’m about to buy the gummy bear flavor even tho i don’t need more yet.

Yes there were bad reviews but the good ones were way more. I have been struggling with my lips and have been looking for a product that would help.

This did not usually happen to me so it shocked me when it happened due to this product. I dont know if its cause I got peppermint flavor or not, but I do not recommend.

I find Sweet Candy and Vanilla are the ones I reach for most and would love/use Gummy Bear (grape) more if it weren’t so pigmented — risk of staining (smells so good though!). Personally, I don’t understand what’s to like about the Berry scent, it’s pretty meh and I would never buy Berry in full size... About GINGERSNAP — I purchased that one based on a few reviews I read about it smelling more like caramel/cookie. At first, it kinda did have a caramel-like scent, but once you put it on your lips it reminds me more of *just* smashed ginger root ... which, I wasn’t expecting because it’s so different than the rest. Scent is kinda reminiscent of unsweetened ginger tea, perhaps? I personally don’t get any kind of cookie anything off of it... Disappointed. I tried to keep using it, but honestly, given the size of the pot, there was no way I could have used the full container or even 1/2 without eventually hating it entirely. Every time I tried to use it the spicy scent of ginger root really threw me off... Had to return. Sad miss. Might be worth a try if you’re really into ginger. (smells spicy, not actually spicy)3 stars because the formula is still good.

There’s around 10 scents of these but they all perform the same task so the real experience besides hydration and repairing is the scent/flavor right? I was SO excited for a Gingersnap flavor since it’s rarely done and love Holiday flavors. This smells NOTHING like a gingersnap cookie AT ALL. It is literally caramel. Those two are not alike at all. I love caramel but bought this for the gingersnap flavor so it’s very disappointing. Bonne Bell nailed lip flavors decades ago so IDK why these new companies act like it’s hard to authentically reproduce peculiar flavors. I will definitely be waiting to smell new scents in store before purchasing going forward.,Caramel *NOT* Gingersnap,medium,brown,normal,brunette,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0,negative\n",

I have used this lip sleeping mask every night for over 3 years now and it has never been over-drying; in fact, I wake up with soft, supple lips every morning, and I find I don’t even need to use lip balm during the day - not even in the cold, dry winter months. This product smells amazing (I’ve used the OG scent as well as the gummy bear), and it is SO worth every penny; one pot lasts me a roughly a year with daily use (a little goes a long way), so it’s honestly a steal.

It is definitely hydrating and unlike other reviews it does last all night. I would say it is great for hydrating but if you have cut or chapped lips it does not heal them (I am a big lip picker and biter). I put a very generous amount on and it works like a charm to hydrate and plump.  I wouldn’t recommend it during the day but as a sleeping mask it’s perfect. Vaseline does work as a dupe but I always feel very pampered and luxurious when I use this. The packaging is also adorable!!!
